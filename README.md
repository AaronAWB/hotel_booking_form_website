## Summary

This is a simple booking form website for a fictional Pittsburgh resort. Completing this project required applying a background image, adjusting element positioning in CSS, and using the "label" and "select" HTML elements to create usable form fields. Each form field is "required," so that it displays an error message if the user does not enter any information. The menus return a value of "" if the user does not select a number, also triggering an error prompting the user to select an item from the list.
